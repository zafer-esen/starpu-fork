The makefile in this directory should be used to test the compilation and execution of StarPU examples against an installed version of StarPU.

For example, if StarPU is installed in

$HOME/softs/starpu-1.1

and the examples to be tested in

$HOME/src/starpu/trunk/examples

one first need to set the following variables

export STARPUPATH=$HOME/softs/starpu-1.1
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$STARPUPATH/lib/pkgconfig/:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$STARPUPATH/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

and then call

make STARPU=starpu-1.1 EXAMPLE=$HOME/src/starpu/trunk/examples

to produce the executables.

Examples using an old StarPU API can also be tested, for example the branch 1.0

make STARPU=starpu-1.0 EXAMPLE=$HOME/src/starpu/branches/starpu-1.0/examples/

Note the variable STARPU is set to starpu-1.0 to use the 1.0 API.
