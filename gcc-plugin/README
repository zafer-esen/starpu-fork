StarPU's GCC Plug-In
=====================

This directory contains an (experimental) GCC plug-in that provides C
language extensions to make it easier to define and invoke StarPU
tasks.

Plug-ins are supported starting from GCC 4.5.

To run the test suite, GNU Guile 1.8.x or 2.0.x is needed.

When building from SVN, GNU Bison 2.5+ is required.
